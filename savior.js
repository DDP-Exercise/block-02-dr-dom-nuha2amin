 *     About time, savior - we need your help!
 *     Dr. DOM has attacked our webpage and spread his
 *     chaos all over it! We called our heroes, but he
 *     took them all captive! He summoned his list of
 *     minions to bother our users. We are in deep trouble!
 *
 *     Please, savior, >>RESTORE OUR OLD WEBPAGE<<!
 *     The people from the internets need you!
 *
 *     We shouldn't need to talk about this, but please,
 *     savior, stick to our ways and traditions! Do not
 *     fall for the dark side, don't use dark HTML or CSS
 *     magic to save us! Lydia, the goddess of judgment
 *     is watching. We have to do it the right way.
 *     The JavaScript way!
